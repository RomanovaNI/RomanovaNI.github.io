        <p class="paragragh1"> Once upon a time I arrived at this place and my heart started to beat different. I opened
            for myself that the life can be much more than routine. Maybe routine but routine with taste, colours and
            every single day happiness. This quite small state has everything what your soul wishes. I invite you to
            discover this region with me.</p>
       
        
            <h3>Nature</h3>
            <p><img src="img/sky.jpg" alt="sky" class="left"></p>
            <p class="nature">
                California is the region with variety of nature’s miracles: my favourite spot is PSSS. I call so Pacific
                Ocean, Sand, Sun and Sky. Once you look up you ll be in love with amazing mix of blue sky and white
                clouds, <img src="img/park.jpg" alt="Yosemitepark" class="right">looks like Monet was here and painted it.
                The strong energy of Pacific captures your heart. Sun presents you every day happy mood and smile. Once you meet here sunset, you ll never forget it’s colourfulness. California suggests you also mountains, worldwide famous parks and much breathtaking views.</p> 
           
            
            <h3>Organic food</h3>
            <p class="food">
                <img src="img/restaurant.jpg" alt="restaurant" class="left"> People here are going crazy
                about healthy, organic, veggies food. All restaurants are fighting for the customers. Some bakes organic
                bread, some creates veggies masterpiece, some produces natural cheese.
                Here couple of my recommendations where you ll get tasty and organic food/Wineries ( I have not yet
                visited wineries of California but here are some of the most famous of them where you can book the
                excursions and get drunk
            </p>
            
            <h3>Sport</h3>
            <p class="sport">
                <img src="img/surfing.jpg" alt="surfing" class="left"> As we have already known California
                has Pacific and Pacific is not calm ocean - that means it’s a perfect location for surfing. The beaches <img
                    src="img/skiing.jpg" alt="skiing" class="right">
                here are wide and it has also well еquipped path for jogging. The day of every second Californian starts
                with jogging. And sure, when the winter and holiday come, you are welcome at Ski resort. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
